DeclanBarrett (71):
      Added all of the previously worked on HTML and CSS to the static files. Segmented between index and base, with base being the standard setup and navbar. Implemented a basic register and login system which required building the models - which has also been created for the entire project based off of documentation provided but can and probably shoudl be edited to fit new requirements.
      Specified that the existing card on the homepage is a placeholder - and made it so that when there is restaurants added to the detabase they will fill the index page with cards (may need more formatting surroundiing rows)
      Moved images to images instead of img - got the create restaurants page working without the current status, ratings or comments connecting to it - restaurants can be created and their images uploaded.
      Added a maximum number of reservations that can be made. Got the status working in the Index page.
      wiped database - added a caption to the restaurant form
      Implemented Comments, including the star rating in the Index
      Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/DeclanBarrett/BoutiqueEats
      Fixed the merge bugs - comments working and the index and restaurant both have working star averages
      Removed random photos and added the database to the gitignore so that when updating the database will need to be overwritten and wont cause problems where the database structure no longer matches the form design.
      Created a new branch called unstable to save the project when there is still errors in the code. Do not pull from this repository. Created account profile pictures and a default picture
      Put the reservations form into its own html file and made it a widget. Comments are still working but the reservation form exists without it actually creating the reservation of checking that it is within opening times
      merged unstable into main
      Opening times is now fulling working
      add sitedata to ignore
      Merge branch 'unstable' into declan-unstable
      Merge branch 'master' into declan-unstable
      Update .gitignore
      removing since the \ is the escape character
      Delete site data
      updating gitignore
      Update .gitignore
      Delete sitedata.sqlite
      hopefully finally fixing this messy git

      Attempting to get Heroku deployment working again
      Still not working - but attempting to have database creation afterwards
      Unignoring the sql database so that Heroku can use it
      Made index filtering completely work
      Made it so that bookings can only occur within opening hours

      changing git ignore since there are errors in the heroku
      Still has the create restaurant error
      changed the requirements file since create restaurants works locally but not on host machine
      Changed it back
